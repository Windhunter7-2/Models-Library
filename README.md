# Models Library
This will be a utility that will have multiple ways of searching for a type of potential model you’re looking for (Depending on your purpose), by keyword, by categories, etc. The models found will be from multiple websites, such as CG-Trader, Models-Resource, and TF3DM, as examples, and the user will have the option to sort by commercially vs. non-commercially usable, with all the websites having libraries that would get updated on occasion.


The program will operate both on keyword tags (For search indexing) and generic tags (Such as “biped”, “cat”, etc.), and a tagger program / user tag request program will be a sub-program of this program.
